## Eventsâ€¦
â€¦are three-part codey bits:
1. broadcaster of arguments (ğŸ“¡)
2. signal, which is those arguments
3. receiver of the signal, whose signature matches the signal (ğŸ“»)

The name of events will typically be past tense, to denote that they *just* happened. Emoji come after the name, to denote whether they are broadcasters or receivers.

/*:
### Rationale for these Emoji
* ğŸ“¡: An event is a signal being broadcast.
* ğŸ“»: A radio acquires a signal and does something meaningful with it.
### Possibilities
* ğŸ“¡s might be functions or `MultiClosure`s.
* ğŸ“»s might be functions, closures, or `EquatableClosure`s.

Use the simplest thing that works, in each case.
