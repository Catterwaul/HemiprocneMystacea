/*:
## Events…
…are three-part codey bits:
1. transmitter of arguments (📡)
2. signal, which is those arguments
3. receiver of the signal, whose signature matches the signal (📻)

The name of events will typically be past tense, to denote that they *just* happened. Emoji come after the name, to denote whether they are broadcasters or receivers.

/*:
### Rationale for these Emoji
* 📡: An event is a signal being transmitted.
* 📻: A radio receives a signal and does something meaningful with it.
### Pronunciation
* 📡: Say "transmit" before the English. It's backwards but easier to work with the autocompletion this way.
* 📻: Say "receive" before the English. 
### Possibilities
* 📡s might be functions or `MultiClosure`s.
* 📻s might be functions, closures, or `EquatableClosure`s.

Use the simplest thing that works, in each case.
