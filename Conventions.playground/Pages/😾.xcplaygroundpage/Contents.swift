## Use a ðŸ˜¾ in front of something whenâ€¦
1. you think it's wrong that you have to use that thing.
2. aside from the ðŸ˜¾, it has the same name as the thing you actually want to use.

*This is a rare example of emoji coming before a name, which emphasizes that the thing is meant to be used (typed) as little as possible.*

### Examples can be found in:
* dequeuedReusableCell.swift
